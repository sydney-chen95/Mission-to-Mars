# Mission-to-Mars

Web scraping for images of Mars’s hemispheres online and adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images.
We'll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
